## The TNM Ontology

*tnm-o* is the abbreviation for and namespace of the **TNM Ontology**. The TNM Ontology represents the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours (TNM) in description logic (OWL). For more details see: https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13326-016-0106-9. 

Objective of this project is to represent the complete TNM Classification system in description logic and provide formal transformation rules between versions. Based on this representation, raw data on clinical and pathological findings can be classified automatically by documentation systems and (partially) transformed between versions.
